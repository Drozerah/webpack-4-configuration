Structure:

![structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drozerah/MyGitHubStorage/master/img/webpack-simple-settings/tree-structure.png)

The `webpack.config.js` file provides: 

- HTML markup file export in production
- assets (images) export in production
- main app JS file + JS dependencies export in production
- Dev Server in development
- Babel ES6 to ES5 transpillation with configuration options in production :
    - see the provided `.babelrc` file
- SCSS transpillation
    - __!important__ : the configuration do not provides CSS export file. Note that the CSS only lives into the `main.js` file generated by Webpack even in production
